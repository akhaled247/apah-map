# AP Art History: Interactive Map & Timeline

A static, educational web visualization of the 11/250 required works in the AP Art History curriculum. Designed for classroom exploration, study, and reference, allowing students and educators to explore artworks chronologically and geographically.

> **Note on Progress Count (`X/250 Required Works`):** Wherever "X/250 Required Works" appears (such as in `index.html` and documentation), `X` represents the count of artworks that have been updated with complete notes/analyses out of the total 250 required works.

## 1. Project Overview

This website is a fully static client-side web application deployable directly through **GitHub Pages**. It operates completely from static files (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `JSON`, `Markdown`, `SVG`) with:
* **No runtime backend or database server**
* **No runtime AI API dependencies or secrets**
* **No authentication or server-side execution**
* **No heavy frontend framework overhead** (pure vanilla JavaScript and Leaflet for mapping)

## 4. Artwork Data Model

Every artwork in `data/artworks.json` follows this schema:

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "title": "Beaker with ibex motifs",
  "artist": null,
  "culture": "Susa (Ancient Near East / Elamite)",
  "dateDisplay": "4200–3500 BCE",
  "dateStart": -4200,
  "dateEnd": -3500,
  "dateMidpoint": -3850,
  "medium": "Painted terra cotta",
  "locationDisplay": "Susa, Iran",
  "latitude": 32.189,
  "longitude": 48.257,
  "locationPrecision": "site",
  "unit": 1,
  "dataConfidence": "owner_notes",
  "affccStatus": "complete",
  "sourceUrl": "https://smarthistory.org/bushel-with-ibex-motifs/"
}
```

### Key Principles:
* **Stable CED Identifiers**: The official CED item number (`1..250`) is the primary key.
* **Normalized Numerical Dates**: BCE is negative; CE is positive. Full ranges are preserved for overlap-based filtering.
* **Geographic Accuracy**: Coordinates represent original historical/archaeological sites or regions of origin, not modern museum repositories.

## 5. Adding and Managing Images

Images are managed declaratively through `data/images.json` (the image manifest):

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "title": "Beaker with ibex motifs",
  "images": [
    {
      "src": "images/placeholder/artwork-placeholder.svg",
      "alt": "Beaker with ibex motifs (4200–3500 BCE)",
      "source": "Smarthistory guide: https://smarthistory.org/bushel-with-ibex-motifs/",
      "local": true
    }
  ]
}
```

* **External URLs**: You can replace `"src"` with any direct CDN or image URL.
* **Local Files**: Store images under `images/005/photo.jpg` and set `"src": "images/005/photo.jpg"`.
* **Multiple Images**: Add multiple objects to the `"images"` array to activate the carousel.

## 6. How to Add Source Notes & Generate AFFCC Content

The application uses a 3-level authority model:
1. **Level 1 (CED Metadata)**: Official Course & Exam Description metadata.
2. **Level 2 (Owner Notes)**: Raw notes provided in Markdown or Word.
3. **Level 3 (AI Organization)**: Build-time formatting into clean educational prose without inventing unsupported details.

### Workflow:
1. Place the new notes file in the project (e.g., `data/source/unit-02-ancient-mediterranean.md`).
2. Run the parser script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-affcc.js
   ```
3. The script matches artworks by their CED number (`1..250`) and updates the corresponding `content/affcc/0XX.md` files while keeping all other files intact.
4. Run validation:
   ```bash
   npm run validate
   ```

---

## 7. Validating the Dataset

To ensure dataset integrity before committing or deploying:

```bash
npm run validate
```

The validation suite verifies:
* Exactly 250 artworks are present (IDs 1 through 250).
* No duplicate or missing IDs.
* Every artwork has valid titles, units (1–10), and normalized dates.
* Every artwork has geographic coordinates within valid latitude/longitude bounds.
* Every artwork has an image manifest entry.
* Every artwork has an existing AFFCC markdown content file.

---

## 8. Running Locally

Because the application fetches static JSON and Markdown files via `fetch()`, run it with a local HTTP server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node (npx)
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

---

## 9. Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push the repository to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
2. In your GitHub repository settings:
   - Navigate to **Settings** &rarr; **Pages**.
   - Under **Build and deployment** &rarr; **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
3. The included workflow `.github/workflows/pages.yml` automatically validates the dataset and deploys the site on every push to `main`.

## 10. Updating the CED Dataset in Future Academic Years

If College Board updates the 250 required works in a future academic year:
1. Update the entries in `scripts/build-dataset.js` with the new CED numbers, titles, and units.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/build-dataset.js
   node scripts/generate-affcc.js
   npm run validate
   ```
3. Commit and push the updated repository.
